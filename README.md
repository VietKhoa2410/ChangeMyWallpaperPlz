  Version and Update:
    - 0.1(25/01/2021):
      + It work! :)
      + Have 2 file: "ChangeMyWallpaperPlz.jar" and "ChangeMyWallpaperPlz.exe"
      + The .jar can be use by command line but if you turn off command line, it will turn off too.
      + The .exe can run without any dependency. The only problem is I dont know how to turn off it :) Yes, you can restart laptop/pc to let it down.
      + I will make something to stop the .exe . Other one is I wanna check how many hardware it take and I hope I can reduce it.
